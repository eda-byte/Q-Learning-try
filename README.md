Problem to solve
The problem to solve will be to optimize the flows inside the following warehouse:
The warehouse belongs to an online retail company that sells products to a variety 
of customers. Inside this warehouse, the products are stored in 12 different locations, 
labeled by the following letters from A to L:
As the orders are placed by the customers online, an Autonomous Warehouse Robot is moving
around the warehouse to collect the products for future deliveries.  

Location G has priority 1, which means it is the top priority,
as it contains a product that must be collected and delivered immediately.
Our Autonomous Warehouse Robot must move to location G by the shortest route 
depending on where it is. 
Our goal is to build an AI that will return that shortest route, 
wherever the robot is.
